#Overview
This authentication application is based on a combination of several different scotch tutorials, covering several forms of authentication. There are front end route changes implemented, but the actual post methods being implemented within several of the public/js/services are not being implemented to the server, handled via html submit posts.

I've connected a few dots and expanded a bit on the skotch.io tutorials as I work my way through a practical application example, as a resource.
